# Material Shell
## A material tiling shell replacement for GNOME Shell to simplify your workflow and accelerate your productivity.

The project is based on my earlier work on [Material Awesome](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-awesome). This GNOME Shell extension provides a performant, opinionated mouse/keyboard workflow and follows the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io).
