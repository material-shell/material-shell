     * The NMMetered enum has two different purposes: one is to configure
     * "connection.metered" setting of a connection profile in #NMSettingConnection, and
     * the other is to express the actual metered state of the #NMDevice at a given moment.
     *
     * For the connection profile only #NM_METERED_UNKNOWN, #NM_METERED_NO
     * and #NM_METERED_YES are allowed.
     *
     * The device's metered state at runtime is determined by the profile
     * which is currently active. If the profile explicitly specifies #NM_METERED_NO
     * or #NM_METERED_YES, then the device's metered state is as such.
     * If the connection profile leaves it undecided at #NM_METERED_UNKNOWN (the default),
     * then NetworkManager tries to guess the metered state, for example based on the
     * device type or on DHCP options (like Android devices exposing a "ANDROID_METERED"
     * DHCP vendor option). This then leads to either #NM_METERED_GUESS_NO or #NM_METERED_GUESS_YES.
     *
     * Most applications probably should treat the runtime state #NM_METERED_GUESS_YES
     * like #NM_METERED_YES, and all other states as not metered.
     *
     * Note that the per-device metered states are then combined to a global metered
     * state. This is basically the metered state of the device with the best default
     * route. However, that generalization of a global metered state may not be correct
     * if the default routes for IPv4 and IPv6 are on different devices, or if policy
     * routing is configured. In general, the global metered state tries to express whether
     * the traffic is likely metered, but since that depends on the traffic itself,
     * there is not one answer in all cases. Hence, an application may want to consider
     * the per-device's metered states.

         * their (internal) result callback still needs to be dispatched by iterating
         * the client's main context.
         *
         * You thus cannot stop iterating the client's main context until
         * everything is wrapped up. nm_client_get_context_busy_watcher()
         * helps to watch how long that will be.
         *
         * This function automates that waiting. Like all glib async operations
         * this honors the current g_main_context_get_thread_default().
         *
         * In any case, to complete the shutdown, nm_client_get_main_context()

         * the same as nm_client_get_main_context(), then `integrate_maincontext`
         * is ignored. In that case, the caller is required to iterate the context
         * for shutdown to complete. Otherwise, if g_main_context_get_thread_default()
         * differs from nm_client_get_main_context() and `integrate_maincontext`
         * is %FALSE, the caller must make sure that both contexts are iterated
         * until completion. Otherwise, if `integrate_maincontext` is %TRUE, then
         * nm_client_get_main_context() will be integrated in g_main_context_get_thread_default().
         * This means, the caller gives nm_client_get_main_context() up until the waiting
         * completes, the function will acquire the context and hook it into
         * g_main_context_get_thread_default().
         * It is a bug to request `integrate_maincontext` while having nm_client_get_main_context()
         * acquired or iterated otherwise because a context can only be acquired once
         * at a time.
         *
         * Shutdown can only complete after all references to `client` were released.
         *
         * It is possible to call this function multiple times for the same client.
         * But note that with `integrate_maincontext` the client's context is acquired,
         * which can only be done once at a time.
         *
         * It is permissible to start waiting before the objects is fully initialized.
         *
         * The function really allows two separate things. To get a notification (callback) when
         * shutdown is complete, and to integrate the client's context in another context.
         * The latter case is useful if the client has a separate context and you hand it
         * over to another GMainContext to wrap up.
         *
         * The main use is to have a NMClient and a separate GMainContext on a worker
         * thread. When being done, you can hand over the cleanup of the context
         * to g_main_context_default(), assuming that the main thread iterates
         * the default context. In that case, you don't need to care about passing
         * a callback to know when shutdown completed.
         * @param integrate_maincontext whether to hook the client's maincontext   in the current thread default. Otherwise, you must ensure   that the client's maincontext gets iterated so that it can complete.

         * Creates a new #NMClient synchronously.
         *
         * Note that this will block until a NMClient instance is fully initialized.
         * This does nothing beside calling g_initable_new(). You are free to call
         * g_initable_new() or g_object_new()/g_initable_init() directly for more
         * control, to set GObject properties or get access to the NMClient instance
         * while it is still initializing.
         *
         * Using the synchronous initialization creates an #NMClient instance
         * that uses an internal #GMainContext. This context is invisible to the
         * user. This introduces an additional overhead that is payed not
         * only during object initialization, but for the entire lifetime of
         * this object.
         * Also, due to this internal #GMainContext, the events are no longer
         * in sync with other messages from #GDBusConnection (but all events
         * of the NMClient will themselves still be ordered).
         * For a serious program, you should therefore avoid these problems by
         * using g_async_initable_init_async() or nm_client_new_async() instead.
         * The sync initialization is still useful for simple scripts or interactive
         * testing for example via pygobject.
         *
         * Creating an #NMClient instance can only fail for two reasons. First, if you didn't
         * provide a %NM_CLIENT_DBUS_CONNECTION and the call to g_bus_get()
         * fails. You can avoid that by using g_initable_new() directly and
         * set a D-Bus connection.
         * Second, if you cancelled the creation. If you do that, then note
         * that after the failure there might still be idle actions pending
         * which keep nm_client_get_main_context() alive. That means,
         * in that case you must continue iterating the context to avoid
         * leaks. See nm_client_get_context_busy_watcher().
         *
         * Creating an #NMClient instance when NetworkManager is not running
         * does not cause a failure.

         * Note that this will block until a NMClient instance is fully initialized.

         * g_initable_new() or g_object_new()/g_initable_init() directly for more
         * control, to set GObject properties or get access to the NMClient instance
         * while it is still initializing.
         *
         * Using the synchronous initialization creates an #NMClient instance
         * that uses an internal #GMainContext. This context is invisible to the
         * user. This introduces an additional overhead that is payed not
         * only during object initialization, but for the entire lifetime of
         * this object.
         * Also, due to this internal #GMainContext, the events are no longer
         * in sync with other messages from #GDBusConnection (but all events
         * of the NMClient will themselves still be ordered).
         * For a serious program, you should therefore avoid these problems by
         * using g_async_initable_init_async() or nm_client_new_async() instead.
         * The sync initialization is still useful for simple scripts or interactive
         * testing for example via pygobject.
         *
         * Creating an #NMClient instance can only fail for two reasons. First, if you didn't
         * provide a %NM_CLIENT_DBUS_CONNECTION and the call to g_bus_get()
         * fails. You can avoid that by using g_initable_new() directly and
         * set a D-Bus connection.
         * Second, if you cancelled the creation. If you do that, then note
         * that after the failure there might still be idle actions pending
         * which keep nm_client_get_main_context() alive. That means,
         * in that case you must continue iterating the context to avoid

             *
             * If the property is set to "eui64", the addresses will be generated using
             * the interface token derived from the hardware address. This makes the
             * host part of the address constant, making it possible to track the
             * host's presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the
             * interface hardware is replaced. If a duplicate address is detected,
             * there is no fallback to generate another address. When configured, the
             * "ipv6.token" is used instead of the MAC address to generate addresses
             * for stateless autoconfiguration.
             *
             * If the property is set to "stable-privacy", the interface identifier is
             * generated as specified by RFC7217. This works by hashing a host specific
             * key (see NetworkManager(8) manual), the interface name, the connection's
             * "connection.stable-id" property and the address prefix.  This improves
             * privacy by making it harder to use the address to track the host's
             * presence as every prefix and network has a different identifier. Also,
             * the address is stable when the network interface hardware is replaced.
             *
             * The special values "default" and "default-or-eui64" will fallback to the
             * global connection default as documented in the NetworkManager.conf(5)
             * manual. If the global default is not specified, the fallback value is
             * "stable-privacy" or "eui64", respectively.
             *
             * For libnm, the property defaults to "default" since 1.40.  Previously it
             * used to default to "stable-privacy".  On D-Bus, the absence of an
             * addr-gen-mode setting equals "default". For keyfile plugin, the absence
             * of the setting on disk means "default-or-eui64" so that the property
             * doesn't change on upgrade from older versions.
             *
             * Note that this setting is distinct from the Privacy Extensions as

             * When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or

             * is used to query domains in its search list. The search domains determine which
             * name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize
             * name servers based on the domain.  Queries for domains not present in any

             * unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes
             * the sub domain to be shadowed.
             * With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring
