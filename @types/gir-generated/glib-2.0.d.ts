     *
     * As this function performs file I/O, it is recommended to not call it anywhere
     * where blocking would cause problems, such as in the main loop of a graphical

     *   lists, metadata etc. may be lost. If `filename` is a symbolic link,
     *   the link itself will be replaced, not the linked file.
     *
     * - On UNIX, if `filename` already exists and is non-empty, and if the system
     *   supports it (via a journalling filesystem or equivalent), and if
     *   %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT is set in `flags,` the `fsync()` call (or
     *   equivalent) will be used to ensure atomic replacement: `filename`
     *   will contain either its old contents or `contents,` even in the face of
     *   system power loss, the disk being unsafely removed, etc.
     *
     * - On UNIX, if `filename` does not already exist or is empty, there is a
     *   possibility that system power loss etc. after calling this function will
     *   leave `filename` empty or full of NUL bytes, depending on the underlying
     *   filesystem, unless %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_DURABLE and
     *   %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT are set in `flags`.
     *
     * - On Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the
     *   new name, so on Windows there is a race condition between the existing
     *   file being removed and the temporary file being renamed.
     *
     * - On Windows there is no way to remove a file that is open to some
     *   process, or mapped into memory. Thus, this function will fail if
     *   `filename` already exists and is open.
     *
     * If the call was successful, it returns %TRUE. If the call was not successful,
     * it returns %FALSE and sets `error`. The error domain is %G_FILE_ERROR.
     * Possible error codes are those in the #GFileError enumeration.
     *
     * Note that the name for the temporary file is constructed by appending up
     * to 7 characters to `filename`.
     *
     * If the file didn’t exist before and is created, it will be given the
     * permissions from `mode`. Otherwise, the permissions of the existing file may
     * be changed to `mode` depending on `flags,` or they may remain unchanged.

     * the name of the program must be a full path. If `flags` contains the

     * set, the `PATH` variable from `envp` takes precedence over the
     * environment variable.
     *
     * If the program name is not a full path and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag
     * is not used, then the program will be run from the current directory
     * (or `working_directory,` if specified); this might be unexpected or even
     * dangerous in some cases when the current directory is world-writable.
     *
     * On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
     * this function and the other `g_spawn*()` functions are in UTF-8, the
     * GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
     * the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
     * available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
     * to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
     * tools it is enough to make the program have a `wmain()` instead of
     * `main()`. `wmain()` has a wide character argument vector as parameter.
     *
     * At least currently, mingw doesn't support `wmain()`, so if you use
     * mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
     * g_win32_get_command_line() to get arguments in UTF-8.
     *
     * On Windows the low-level child process creation API `CreateProcess()`
     * doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
     * library's `spawn*()` family of functions (which g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
     * eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
     * a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
     * reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
     * passed to `main()`. Complications arise when you have argument vector
     * elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
     * don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
     * code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
     * arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
     * asymmetry, g_spawn_async_with_pipes() will do quoting and escaping on
     * argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
     * `spawn()` function.
     *
     * The returned `child_pid` on Windows is a handle to the child
     * process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
     * identifiers are different concepts on Windows.
     *
     * `envp` is a %NULL-terminated array of strings, where each string
     * has the form `KEY=VALUE`. This will become the child's environment.
     * If `envp` is %NULL, the child inherits its parent's environment.
     *
     * `flags` should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
     * function's behaviour. The %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD means that the
     * child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
     * (g_child_watch_add()) to be notified about the death of the child process,
     * otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
     * Eventually you must call g_spawn_close_pid() on the `child_pid,` in order to
     * free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
     * using a child watch is equivalent to calling waitpid() or handling
     * the `SIGCHLD` signal manually. On Windows, calling g_spawn_close_pid()
     * is equivalent to calling `CloseHandle()` on the process handle returned
     * in `child_pid)`. See g_child_watch_add().
     *
     * Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
     * closed in the child process. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN means that
     * other open file descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
     * descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before calling `exec()`
     * in the child. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH means that `argv[`0] need not be an
     * absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` environment
     * variable. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP means need not be an
     * absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from
     * `envp`. If both %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP
     * are used, the value from `envp` takes precedence over the environment.
     *
     * %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN means that the child will inherit the parent's
     * standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
     * `/dev/null`). %G_SPAWN_STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL explicitly imposes the default
     * behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in both cases,
     * the `stdin_pipe_out` argument is ignored.
     *
     * %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard output
     * will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
     * standard output). %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDOUT explicitly imposes the
     * default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
     * both cases, the `stdout_pipe_out` argument is ignored.
     *
     * %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard error
     * will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
     * standard error). %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDERR explicitly imposes the
     * default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
     * both cases, the `stderr_pipe_out` argument is ignored.
     *
     * It is valid to pass the same FD in multiple parameters (e.g. you can pass
     * a single FD for both `stdout_fd` and `stderr_fd,` and include it in
     * `source_fds` too).
     *
     * `source_fds` and `target_fds` allow zero or more FDs from this process to be
     * remapped to different FDs in the spawned process. If `n_fds` is greater than
     * zero, `source_fds` and `target_fds` must both be non-%NULL and the same length.
     * Each FD in `source_fds` is remapped to the FD number at the same index in
     * `target_fds`. The source and target FD may be equal to simply propagate an FD
     * to the spawned process. FD remappings are processed after standard FDs, so
     * any target FDs which equal `stdin_fd,` `stdout_fd` or `stderr_fd` will overwrite
     * them in the spawned process.
     *
     * `source_fds` is supported on Windows since 2.72.
     *
     * %G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO means that the first element of `argv` is
     * the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
     * argument vector to pass to the file. Normally g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
     * uses `argv[`0] as the file to execute, and passes all of `argv` to the child.
     *
     * `child_setup` and `user_data` are a function and user data. On POSIX
     * platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
     * performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
     * pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling `exec()`.
     * That is, `child_setup` is called just before calling `exec()` in the
     * child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
     * the child, not the parent.
     *
     * On Windows, there is no separate `fork()` and `exec()` functionality.
     * Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
     * `CreateProcess()`. There is no sensible thing `child_setup`
     * could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.
     *
     * If non-%NULL, `child_pid` will on Unix be filled with the child's
     * process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the child,
     * or to use g_child_watch_add() (or `waitpid()`) if you specified the
     * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. On Windows, `child_pid` will be
     * filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
     * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. You can then access the child
     * process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
     * with the `WaitFor*()` functions, or examine its exit code with
     * `GetExitCodeProcess()`. You should close the handle with `CloseHandle()`
     * or g_spawn_close_pid() when you no longer need it.
     *
     * If non-%NULL, the `stdin_pipe_out,` `stdout_pipe_out,` `stderr_pipe_out`
     * locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's

     * If `stdin_pipe_out` is %NULL, the child's standard input is attached to
     * `/dev/null` unless %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN is set.

     *
     * `error` can be %NULL to ignore errors, or non-%NULL to report errors.

     * address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are
     * not relevant in the context of immediately executing a distinct process.

     * are met:
     *
     * 1. %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD is set
     * 2. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN is set
     * 3. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP is not set
     * 4. `working_directory` is %NULL
     * 5. `child_setup` is %NULL
     * 6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang.
     *    Otherwise, GLib will have to execute the program through the
     *    shell, which is not done using the optimized codepath.
     *
     * If you are writing a GTK application, and the program you are spawning is a
     * graphical application too, then to ensure that the spawned program opens its

     * `wait_status`. On Windows, it is always the case.
     *
     * The special semantics are that the actual exit code will be the
     * code set in `error,` and the domain will be %G_SPAWN_EXIT_ERROR.
     * This allows you to differentiate between different exit codes.
     *
     * If the process was terminated by some means other than an exit
     * status (for example if it was killed by a signal), the domain will be

     * @param separators the separator byte character set between parameters. (usually   `&`, but sometimes `;` or both `&;`). Note that this function works on   bytes not characters, so it can't be used to delimit UTF-8 strings for   anything but ASCII characters. You may pass an empty set, in which case   no splitting will occur.

     * GBookmarkFile lets you parse, edit or create files containing bookmarks
     * to URI, along with some meta-data about the resource pointed by the URI
     * like its MIME type, the application that is registering the bookmark and
     * the icon that should be used to represent the bookmark. The data is stored
     * using the
     * [Desktop Bookmark Specification](http://www.gnome.org/~ebassi/bookmark-spec).
     *
     * The syntax of the bookmark files is described in detail inside the
     * Desktop Bookmark Specification, here is a quick summary: bookmark
     * files use a sub-class of the XML Bookmark Exchange Language
     * specification, consisting of valid UTF-8 encoded XML, under the
     * <xbel> root element; each bookmark is stored inside a
     * <bookmark> element, using its URI: no relative paths can
     * be used inside a bookmark file. The bookmark may have a user defined
     * title and description, to be used instead of the URI. Under the
     * <metadata> element, with its owner attribute set to
     * `http://freedesktop.org`, is stored the meta-data about a resource
     * pointed by its URI. The meta-data consists of the resource's MIME
     * type; the applications that have registered a bookmark; the groups
     * to which a bookmark belongs to; a visibility flag, used to set the
     * bookmark as "private" to the applications and groups that has it
     * registered; the URI and MIME type of an icon, to be used when
     * displaying the bookmark inside a GUI.
     *
     * Here is an example of a bookmark file:
     * [bookmarks.xbel](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/glib/tests/bookmarks.xbel)
     *
     * A bookmark file might contain more than one bookmark; each bookmark
     * is accessed through its URI.
     *
     * The important caveat of bookmark files is that when you add a new
     * bookmark you must also add the application that is registering it, using
     * g_bookmark_file_add_application() or g_bookmark_file_set_application_info().
     * If a bookmark has no applications then it won't be dumped when creating
     * the on disk representation, using g_bookmark_file_to_data() or
     * g_bookmark_file_to_file().
     *
     * The #GBookmarkFile parser was added in GLib 2.12.

         *     if (!g_cond_wait_until (&data_cond, &data_mutex, end_time))
         *       {
         *         // timeout has passed.
         *         g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);

         *
         *
         * Notice that the end time is calculated once, before entering the

    /**
     * The #GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
     * condition. Threads can block on a #GCond if they find a certain
     * condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
     * condition they signal the #GCond, and that causes the waiting
     * threads to be woken up.
     *
     * Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
     * threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
     * another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
     * threads to wake up to collect the data.
     *
     * Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
     * is satisfied:
     *
     * ```c
     *   gpointer current_data = NULL;
     *   GMutex data_mutex;
     *   GCond data_cond;
     *
     *   void
     *   push_data (gpointer data)
     *   {
     *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
     *     current_data = data;
     *     g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
     *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
     *   }
     *
     *   gpointer
     *   pop_data (void)
     *   {
     *     gpointer data;
     *
     *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
     *     while (!current_data)
     *       g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
     *     data = current_data;
     *     current_data = NULL;
     *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
     *
     *     return data;
     *   }
     * ```
     *
     * Whenever a thread calls pop_data() now, it will wait until
     * current_data is non-%NULL, i.e. until some other thread
     * has called push_data().
     *
     * The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
     * paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
     * race between the check of `current_data` by the while loop in
     * pop_data() and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
     * `current_data` after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
     * waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. #GCond is
     * specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
     * to sleep atomically.
     *
     * It is also important to use the g_cond_wait() and g_cond_wait_until()
     * functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
     * true.  See g_cond_wait() for an explanation of why the condition may
     * not be true even after it returns.
     *
     * If a #GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
     * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call g_cond_init()
     * on it and g_cond_clear() when done.
     *
     * A #GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

         * - `%d`: the day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)
         * - `%e`: the day of the month as a decimal number (range 1 to 31);
         *   single digits are preceded by a figure space (U+2007)
         * - `%F`: equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d` (the ISO 8601 date format)
         * - `%g`: the last two digits of the ISO 8601 week-based year as a
         *   decimal number (00-99). This works well with `%V` and `%u`.
         * - `%G`: the ISO 8601 week-based year as a decimal number. This works

         * - `%I`: the hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12)

         * - `%m`: the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12)
         * - `%M`: the minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)
         * - `%f`: the microsecond as a decimal number (range 000000 to 999999)
         * - `%p`: either ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ according to the given time value, or the
         *   corresponding  strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as

         * - `%V`: the ISO 8601 standard week number of the current year as a decimal
         *   number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at
         *   least 4 days in the new year. See g_date_time_get_week_of_year().

         * conversions:
         *
         * - `O`: Use alternative numeric symbols, if the current locale supports those.
         * - `_`: Pad a numeric result with spaces. This overrides the default padding
         *   for the specifier.
         * - `-`: Do not pad a numeric result. This overrides the default padding
         *   for the specifier.
         * - `0`: Pad a numeric result with zeros. This overrides the default padding
         *   for the specifier.
         *
         * Additionally, when `O` is used with `B`, `b`, or `h`, it produces the alternative
         * form of a month name. The alternative form should be used when the month
         * name is used without a day number (e.g., standalone). It is required in
         * some languages (Baltic, Slavic, Greek, and more) due to their grammatical

    /**
     * #GKeyFile lets you parse, edit or create files containing groups of
     * key-value pairs, which we call "key files" for lack of a better name.
     * Several freedesktop.org specifications use key files now, e.g the
     * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec)
     * and the
     * [Icon Theme Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec).
     *
     * The syntax of key files is described in detail in the
     * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
     * here is a quick summary: Key files
     * consists of groups of key-value pairs, interspersed with comments.
     *
     *
     * ```
     * # this is just an example
     * # there can be comments before the first group
     *
     * [First Group]
     *
     * Name=Key File Example\tthis value shows\nescaping
     *
     * # localized strings are stored in multiple key-value pairs
     * Welcome=Hello
     * Welcome[de]=Hallo
     * Welcome[fr_FR]=Bonjour
     * Welcome[it]=Ciao
     * Welcome[be`latin]`=Hello
     *
     * [Another Group]
     *
     * Numbers=2;20;-200;0
     *
     * Booleans=true;false;true;true
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
     *
     * Groups are started by a header line containing the group name enclosed
     * in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next group or
     * the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a group.
     *
     * Key-value pairs generally have the form `key=value`, with the
     * exception of localized strings, which have the form
     * `key[locale]=value`, with a locale identifier of the
     * form `lang_COUNTRY`MODIFIER`` where `COUNTRY` and `MODIFIER`
     * are optional.
     * Space before and after the '=' character are ignored. Newline, tab,
     * carriage return and backslash characters in value are escaped as \n,
     * \t, \r, and \\\\, respectively. To preserve leading spaces in values,
     * these can also be escaped as \s.
     *
     * Key files can store strings (possibly with localized variants), integers,
     * booleans and lists of these. Lists are separated by a separator character,
     * typically ';' or ','. To use the list separator character in a value in
     * a list, it has to be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.
     *
     * This syntax is obviously inspired by the .ini files commonly met
     * on Windows, but there are some important differences:
     *
     * - .ini files use the ';' character to begin comments,
     *   key files use the '#' character.
     *
     * - Key files do not allow for ungrouped keys meaning only
     *   comments can precede the first group.
     *
     * - Key files are always encoded in UTF-8.
     *
     * - Key and Group names are case-sensitive. For example, a group called
     *   [GROUP] is a different from [group].
     *
     * - .ini files don't have a strongly typed boolean entry type,
     *    they only have GetProfileInt(). In key files, only
     *    true and false (in lower case) are allowed.
     *
     * Note that in contrast to the
     * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
     * groups in key files may contain the same
     * key multiple times; the last entry wins. Key files may also contain
     * multiple groups with the same name; they are merged together.
     * Another difference is that keys and group names in key files are not
     * restricted to ASCII characters.
     *
     * Here is an example of loading a key file and reading a value:
     *
     *
     * ```c
     * g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
     * g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
     *
     * if (!g_key_file_load_from_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", flags, &error))
     *   {
     *     if (!g_error_matches (error, G_FILE_ERROR, G_FILE_ERROR_NOENT))
     *       g_warning ("Error loading key file: %s", error->message);
     *     return;
     *   }
     *
     * g_autofree gchar *val = g_key_file_get_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", &error);
     * if (val == NULL &&
     *     !g_error_matches (error, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND))
     *   {
     *     g_warning ("Error finding key in key file: %s", error->message);
     *     return;
     *   }
     * else if (val == NULL)
     *   {
     *     // Fall back to a default value.
     *     val = g_strdup ("default-value");
     *   }
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Here is an example of creating and saving a key file:
     *
     *
     * ```c
     * g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
     * const gchar *val = …;
     * g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
     *
     * g_key_file_set_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", val);
     *
     * // Save as a file.
     * if (!g_key_file_save_to_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", &error))
     *   {
     *     g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
     *     return;
     *   }
     *
     * // Or store to a GBytes for use elsewhere.
     * gsize data_len;
     * g_autofree guint8 *data = (guint8 *) g_key_file_to_data (key_file, &data_len, &error);
     * if (data == NULL)
     *   {
     *     g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
     *     return;
     *   }
     * g_autoptr(GBytes) bytes = g_bytes_new_take (g_steal_pointer (&data), data_len);
     * ```

     * The GOption commandline parser is intended to be a simpler replacement
     * for the popt library. It supports short and long commandline options,
     * as shown in the following example:
     *
     * `testtreemodel -r 1 --max-size 20 --rand --display=:1.0 -vb -- file1 file2`
     *
     * The example demonstrates a number of features of the GOption
     * commandline parser:
     *
     * - Options can be single letters, prefixed by a single dash.
     *
     * - Multiple short options can be grouped behind a single dash.
     *
     * - Long options are prefixed by two consecutive dashes.
     *
     * - Options can have an extra argument, which can be a number, a string or
     *   a filename. For long options, the extra argument can be appended with
     *   an equals sign after the option name, which is useful if the extra
     *   argument starts with a dash, which would otherwise cause it to be
     *   interpreted as another option.
     *
     * - Non-option arguments are returned to the application as rest arguments.
     *
     * - An argument consisting solely of two dashes turns off further parsing,
     *   any remaining arguments (even those starting with a dash) are returned
     *   to the application as rest arguments.
     *
     * Another important feature of GOption is that it can automatically
     * generate nicely formatted help output. Unless it is explicitly turned
     * off with g_option_context_set_help_enabled(), GOption will recognize
     * the `--help`, `-?`, `--help-all` and `--help-groupname` options
     * (where `groupname` is the name of a #GOptionGroup) and write a text
     * similar to the one shown in the following example to stdout.
     *
     *
     * ```
     * Usage:
     *   testtreemodel [OPTION...] - test tree model performance
     *
     * Help Options:
     *   -h, --help               Show help options
     *   --help-all               Show all help options
     *   --help-gtk               Show GTK Options
     *
     * Application Options:
     *   -r, --repeats=N          Average over N repetitions
     *   -m, --max-size=M         Test up to 2^M items
     *   --display=DISPLAY        X display to use
     *   -v, --verbose            Be verbose
     *   -b, --beep               Beep when done
     *   --rand                   Randomize the data
     * ```
     *
     *
     * GOption groups options in #GOptionGroups, which makes it easy to
     * incorporate options from multiple sources. The intended use for this is
     * to let applications collect option groups from the libraries it uses,
     * add them to their #GOptionContext, and parse all options by a single call
     * to g_option_context_parse(). See gtk_get_option_group() for an example.
     *
     * If an option is declared to be of type string or filename, GOption takes
     * care of converting it to the right encoding; strings are returned in
     * UTF-8, filenames are returned in the GLib filename encoding. Note that
     * this only works if setlocale() has been called before
     * g_option_context_parse().
     *
     * Here is a complete example of setting up GOption to parse the example
     * commandline above and produce the example help output.
     *
     * ```c
     * static gint repeats = 2;
     * static gint max_size = 8;
     * static gboolean verbose = FALSE;
     * static gboolean beep = FALSE;
     * static gboolean randomize = FALSE;
     *
     * static GOptionEntry entries[] =
     * {
     *   { "repeats", 'r', 0, G_OPTION_ARG_INT, &repeats, "Average over N repetitions", "N" },
     *   { "max-size", 'm', 0, G_OPTION_ARG_INT, &max_size, "Test up to 2^M items", "M" },
     *   { "verbose", 'v', 0, G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, &verbose, "Be verbose", NULL },
     *   { "beep", 'b', 0, G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, &beep, "Beep when done", NULL },
     *   { "rand", 0, 0, G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, &randomize, "Randomize the data", NULL },
     *   G_OPTION_ENTRY_NULL
     * };
     *
     * int
     * main (int argc, char *argv[])
     * {
     *   GError *error = NULL;
     *   GOptionContext *context;
     *
     *   context = g_option_context_new ("- test tree model performance");
     *   g_option_context_add_main_entries (context, entries, GETTEXT_PACKAGE);
     *   g_option_context_add_group (context, gtk_get_option_group (TRUE));
     *   if (!g_option_context_parse (context, &argc, &argv, &error))
     *     {
     *       g_print ("option parsing failed: %s\n", error->message);
     *       exit (1);
     *     }
     *
     *   ...
     *
     * }
     * ```
     *
     *
     * On UNIX systems, the argv that is passed to main() has no particular
     * encoding, even to the extent that different parts of it may have
     * different encodings.  In general, normal arguments and flags will be
     * in the current locale and filenames should be considered to be opaque
     * byte strings.  Proper use of %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME vs
     * %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING is therefore important.
     *
     * Note that on Windows, filenames do have an encoding, but using
     * #GOptionContext with the argv as passed to main() will result in a
     * program that can only accept commandline arguments with characters
     * from the system codepage.  This can cause problems when attempting to
     * deal with filenames containing Unicode characters that fall outside
     * of the codepage.
     *
     * A solution to this is to use g_win32_get_command_line() and
     * g_option_context_parse_strv() which will properly handle full Unicode
     * filenames.  If you are using #GApplication, this is done
     * automatically for you.
     *
     * The following example shows how you can use #GOptionContext directly
     * in order to correctly deal with Unicode filenames on Windows:
     *
     *
     * ```c
     * int
     * main (int argc, char **argv)
     * {
     *   GError *error = NULL;
     *   GOptionContext *context;
     *   gchar **args;
     *
     * #ifdef G_OS_WIN32
     *   args = g_win32_get_command_line ();
     * #else
     *   args = g_strdupv (argv);
     * #endif
     *
     *   // set up context
     *
     *   if (!g_option_context_parse_strv (context, &args, &error))
     *     {
     *       // error happened
     *     }
     *
     *   ...
     *
     *   g_strfreev (args);

     * The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
     * reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
     * multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
     *
     * The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
     * between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
     * one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
     * lock via g_rw_lock_writer_lock()), multiple threads can gain
     * simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
     * g_rw_lock_reader_lock()).
     *
     * It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
     * lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
     * it.
     *
     * Here is an example for an array with access functions:
     *

     *     if (!array)
     *       return NULL;
     *
     *     g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
     *     if (index < array->len)
     *       retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
     *     g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
     *
     *     return retval;
     *   }
     *
     *   void
     *   my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
     *   {
     *     g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
     *
     *     if (!array)
     *       array = g_ptr_array_new ();
     *
     *     if (index >= array->len)
     *       g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
     *     g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
     *
     *     g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
     *   }
     *  ```
     *
     * This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
     * (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
     * (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
     * and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
     * of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
     * functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
     *
     * If a #GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
     * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
     * g_rw_lock_init() on it and g_rw_lock_clear() when done.

     * The g_regex_*() functions implement regular

     *
     * Some functions accept a `start_position` argument, setting it differs
     * from just passing over a shortened string and setting %G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL
     * in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion.
     * For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
     * in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
     * subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
     * from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
     * always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
     * boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
     * `start_position` set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because
     * it is able to look behind the starting point to discover that it is
     * preceded by a letter.
     *
     * Note that, unless you set the %G_REGEX_RAW flag, all the strings passed
     * to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
     * inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
     * "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "à") is two bytes long but it is treated as a
     * single character. If you set %G_REGEX_RAW the strings can be non-valid
     * UTF-8 strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two
     * bytes and two characters long.
     *
     * When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in
     * the string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline
     * sequence use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character
     * sequence CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed,
     * U+000A, "\n"), VT vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"),
     * CR (carriage return, U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
     * separator, U+2028), or PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
     *
     * The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are
     * affected by newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline
     * character (the same characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed
     * with %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR, %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF and %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF
     * compile options, and with %G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY,

     * The #GUri type and related functions can be used to parse URIs into
     * their components, and build valid URIs from individual components.
     *
     * Note that #GUri scope is to help manipulate URIs in various applications,
     * following [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). In particular,
     * it doesn't intend to cover web browser needs, and doesn't implement the
     * [WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) standard. No APIs are provided to
     * help prevent
     * [homograph attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack), so
     * #GUri is not suitable for formatting URIs for display to the user for making
     * security-sensitive decisions.
     *
     * ## Relative and absolute URIs # {#relative-absolute-uris}
     *
     * As defined in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4), the
     * hierarchical nature of URIs means that they can either be ‘relative
     * references’ (sometimes referred to as ‘relative URIs’) or ‘URIs’ (for
     * clarity, ‘URIs’ are referred to in this documentation as
     * ‘absolute URIs’ — although
     * [in constrast to RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.3),
     * fragment identifiers are always allowed).
     *
     * Relative references have one or more components of the URI missing. In
     * particular, they have no scheme. Any other component, such as hostname,
     * query, etc. may be missing, apart from a path, which has to be specified (but
     * may be empty). The path may be relative, starting with `./` rather than `/`.
     *
     * For example, a valid relative reference is `./path?query`,
     * `/?query#fragment` or `//example.com`.
     *
     * Absolute URIs have a scheme specified. Any other components of the URI which
     * are missing are specified as explicitly unset in the URI, rather than being
     * resolved relative to a base URI using g_uri_parse_relative().
     *
     * For example, a valid absolute URI is `file:///home/bob` or
     * `https://search.com?query=string`.
     *
     * A #GUri instance is always an absolute URI. A string may be an absolute URI
     * or a relative reference; see the documentation for individual functions as to
     * what forms they accept.
     *
     * ## Parsing URIs
     *
     * The most minimalist APIs for parsing URIs are g_uri_split() and
     * g_uri_split_with_user(). These split a URI into its component
     * parts, and return the parts; the difference between the two is that
     * g_uri_split() treats the ‘userinfo’ component of the URI as a
     * single element, while g_uri_split_with_user() can (depending on the
     * #GUriFlags you pass) treat it as containing a username, password,
     * and authentication parameters. Alternatively, g_uri_split_network()
     * can be used when you are only interested in the components that are
     * needed to initiate a network connection to the service (scheme,
     * host, and port).
     *
     * g_uri_parse() is similar to g_uri_split(), but instead of returning
     * individual strings, it returns a #GUri structure (and it requires
     * that the URI be an absolute URI).
     *
     * g_uri_resolve_relative() and g_uri_parse_relative() allow you to
     * resolve a relative URI relative to a base URI.
     * g_uri_resolve_relative() takes two strings and returns a string,
     * and g_uri_parse_relative() takes a #GUri and a string and returns a
     * #GUri.
     *
     * All of the parsing functions take a #GUriFlags argument describing
     * exactly how to parse the URI; see the documentation for that type
     * for more details on the specific flags that you can pass. If you
     * need to choose different flags based on the type of URI, you can
     * use g_uri_peek_scheme() on the URI string to check the scheme
     * first, and use that to decide what flags to parse it with.
     *
     * For example, you might want to use %G_URI_PARAMS_WWW_FORM when parsing the
     * params for a web URI, so compare the result of g_uri_peek_scheme() against
     * `http` and `https`.
     *
     * ## Building URIs
     *
     * g_uri_join() and g_uri_join_with_user() can be used to construct
     * valid URI strings from a set of component strings. They are the
     * inverse of g_uri_split() and g_uri_split_with_user().
     *
     * Similarly, g_uri_build() and g_uri_build_with_user() can be used to
     * construct a #GUri from a set of component strings.
     *
     * As with the parsing functions, the building functions take a
     * #GUriFlags argument. In particular, it is important to keep in mind
     * whether the URI components you are using are already `%`-encoded. If so,
     * you must pass the %G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED flag.
     *
     * ## `file://` URIs
     *
     * Note that Windows and Unix both define special rules for parsing
     * `file://` URIs (involving non-UTF-8 character sets on Unix, and the
     * interpretation of path separators on Windows). #GUri does not
     * implement these rules. Use g_filename_from_uri() and
     * g_filename_to_uri() if you want to properly convert between
     * `file://` URIs and local filenames.
     *
     * ## URI Equality
     *
     * Note that there is no `g_uri_equal ()` function, because comparing
     * URIs usefully requires scheme-specific knowledge that #GUri does
     * not have. #GUri can help with normalization if you use the various
     * encoded #GUriFlags as well as %G_URI_FLAGS_SCHEME_NORMALIZE however
     * it is not comprehensive.
     * For example, `data:,foo` and `data:;base64,Zm9v` resolve to the same
     * thing according to the `data:` URI specification which GLib does not
     * handle.

         * this function is helpful.
         *
         * The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
         * that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
         * #GVariant.  We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
         * return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
         * where the value that is being returned already exists).

         * typing if they are allowed to return a #GVariant with a floating
         * reference.

         * the one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
         * that has been converted to a full reference.

         * This function has an odd interaction when combined with
         * g_variant_ref_sink() running at the same time in another thread on

    /**
     * #GVariant is a variant datatype; it can contain one or more values
     * along with information about the type of the values.
     *
     * A #GVariant may contain simple types, like an integer, or a boolean value;
     * or complex types, like an array of two strings, or a dictionary of key
     * value pairs. A #GVariant is also immutable: once it's been created neither
     * its type nor its content can be modified further.
     *
     * GVariant is useful whenever data needs to be serialized, for example when
     * sending method parameters in D-Bus, or when saving settings using GSettings.
     *
     * When creating a new #GVariant, you pass the data you want to store in it
     * along with a string representing the type of data you wish to pass to it.
     *
     * For instance, if you want to create a #GVariant holding an integer value you
     * can use:
     *
     *
     * ```c
     *   GVariant *v = g_variant_new ("u", 40);
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The string "u" in the first argument tells #GVariant that the data passed to
     * the constructor (40) is going to be an unsigned integer.
     *
     * More advanced examples of #GVariant in use can be found in documentation for
     * [GVariant format strings][gvariant-format-strings-pointers].
     *
     * The range of possible values is determined by the type.
     *
     * The type system used by #GVariant is #GVariantType.
     *
     * #GVariant instances always have a type and a value (which are given
     * at construction time).  The type and value of a #GVariant instance
     * can never change other than by the #GVariant itself being
     * destroyed.  A #GVariant cannot contain a pointer.
     *
     * #GVariant is reference counted using g_variant_ref() and
     * g_variant_unref().  #GVariant also has floating reference counts --
     * see g_variant_ref_sink().
     *
     * #GVariant is completely threadsafe.  A #GVariant instance can be
     * concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
     * problems.
     *
     * #GVariant is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialized
     * form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
     * files.  It can perform nearly all deserialization operations in a
     * small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
     * Serialized #GVariant data can also be sent over the network.
     *
     * #GVariant is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
     * #GVariant instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See #GVariantType for
     * exceptions.  (However, #GVariant's serialization format is not the same
     * as the serialization format of a D-Bus message body: use #GDBusMessage,
     * in the gio library, for those.)
     *
     * For space-efficiency, the #GVariant serialization format does not
     * automatically include the variant's length, type or endianness,
     * which must either be implied from context (such as knowledge that a
     * particular file format always contains a little-endian
     * %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT which occupies the whole length of the file)
     * or supplied out-of-band (for instance, a length, type and/or endianness
     * indicator could be placed at the beginning of a file, network message
     * or network stream).
     *
     * A #GVariant's size is limited mainly by any lower level operating
     * system constraints, such as the number of bits in #gsize.  For
     * example, it is reasonable to have a 2GB file mapped into memory
     * with #GMappedFile, and call g_variant_new_from_data() on it.
     *
     * For convenience to C programmers, #GVariant features powerful
     * varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is
     * designed to be embedded in other libraries.
     *
     * There is a Python-inspired text language for describing #GVariant
     * values.  #GVariant includes a printer for this language and a parser
     * with type inferencing.
     *
     * ## Memory Use
     *
     * #GVariant tries to be quite efficient with respect to memory use.
     * This section gives a rough idea of how much memory is used by the
     * current implementation.  The information here is subject to change
     * in the future.
     *
     * The memory allocated by #GVariant can be grouped into 4 broad
     * purposes: memory for serialized data, memory for the type
     * information cache, buffer management memory and memory for the
     * #GVariant structure itself.
     *
     * ## Serialized Data Memory
     *
     * This is the memory that is used for storing GVariant data in
     * serialized form.  This is what would be sent over the network or
     * what would end up on disk, not counting any indicator of the
     * endianness, or of the length or type of the top-level variant.
     *
     * The amount of memory required to store a boolean is 1 byte. 16,
     * 32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
     * use their "natural" size.  Strings (including object path and
     * signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
     * use the length of the string plus 1 byte.
     *
     * Maybe types use no space at all to represent the null value and
     * use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
     * equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.
     *
     * Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
     * members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
     * array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
     * then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
     * size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
     * overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
     * are added as required for alignment of child values.
     *
     * Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
     * required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
     * framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
     * the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
     * bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.
     *
     * Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
     * variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
     * item inside the variant.
     *
     * As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
     * In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
     * the serialization.
     *
     * If we add an item "width" that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
     * we will use 4 byte to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
     * containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
     * aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that's 2 extra
     * bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
     * for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
     * array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.
     *
     * If we add another entry, "title" that maps to a nullable string
     * that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
     * null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
     * its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
     * padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.
     *
     * We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
     * After the 14 bytes of the first item, that's 2 bytes required.
     * We now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two
     * bytes. 14 + 2 + 11 + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item
     * dictionary.
     *
     * ## Type Information Cache
     *
     * For each GVariant type that currently exists in the program a type
     * information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
     * type information structure is required for rapid deserialization.
     *
     * Continuing with the above example, if a #GVariant exists with the
     * type "a{sv}" then a type information struct will exist for
     * "a{sv}", "{sv}", "s", and "v".  Multiple uses of the same type
     * will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
     * single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
     * not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
     * #GVariant.
     *
     * Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
     * memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
     * container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
     * maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
     * are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.
     *
     * Array type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus the
     * memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
     * on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for "a{sv}" would require 30
     * bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
     *
     * Tuple type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus 4 *
     * sizeof (void *) for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
     * required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
     * example, would have a type information structure that consumed
     * writable memory in the size of 14 * sizeof (void *) (plus type
     * string)  This means that on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for
     * "{sv}" would require 61 bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
     *
     * This means that in total, for our "a{sv}" example, 91 bytes of
     * type information would be allocated.
     *
     * The type information cache, additionally, uses a #GHashTable to
     * store and look up the cached items and stores a pointer to this
     * hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
     * are zero items in the type cache.
     *
     * Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
     * that a program will probably only have a very small number of
     * different types of values in it and that only one type information
     * structure is required for many different values of the same type.
     *
     * ## Buffer Management Memory
     *
     * #GVariant uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
     * with the various different possible sources of serialized data
     * that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
     * correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
     * #GVariant.  This may involve a g_free() or a g_slice_free() or
     * even g_mapped_file_unref().
     *
     * One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
     * serialized data.  The size of the buffer management structure
     * is 4 * (void *).  On 32-bit systems, that's 16 bytes.
     *
     * ## GVariant structure
     *
     * The size of a #GVariant structure is 6 * (void *).  On 32-bit
     * systems, that's 24 bytes.
     *
     * #GVariant structures only exist if they are explicitly created
     * with API calls.  For example, if a #GVariant is constructed out of
     * serialized data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
     * then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
     * entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
     * the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
     * only 1 #GVariant instance exists -- the one referring to the
     * dictionary.
     *
     * If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
     * #GVariant instances will exist for those values only for as long
     * as they are in use (ie: until you call g_variant_unref()).  The
     * type information is shared.  The serialized data and the buffer
     * management structure for that serialized data is shared by the
     * child.
     *
     * ## Summary
     *
     * To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
     * strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
     * using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 bytes of memory
     * for the serialized data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
     * bytes for the #GVariant instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
     * malloc overhead.  If we were to use g_variant_get_child_value() to
     * access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
     * bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
     * would use more memory for the serialized data and buffer
     * management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
     * be shared.

    /**
     * #GVariantDict is a mutable interface to #GVariant dictionaries.
     *
     * It can be used for doing a sequence of dictionary lookups in an
     * efficient way on an existing #GVariant dictionary or it can be used
     * to construct new dictionaries with a hashtable-like interface.  It
     * can also be used for taking existing dictionaries and modifying them
     * in order to create new ones.
     *
     * #GVariantDict can only be used with %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARDICT
     * dictionaries.
     *
     * It is possible to use #GVariantDict allocated on the stack or on the
     * heap.  When using a stack-allocated #GVariantDict, you begin with a
     * call to g_variant_dict_init() and free the resources with a call to
     * g_variant_dict_clear().
     *
     * Heap-allocated #GVariantDict follows normal refcounting rules: you
     * allocate it with g_variant_dict_new() and use g_variant_dict_ref()
     * and g_variant_dict_unref().
     *
     * g_variant_dict_end() is used to convert the #GVariantDict back into a
     * dictionary-type #GVariant.  When used with stack-allocated instances,
     * this also implicitly frees all associated memory, but for
     * heap-allocated instances, you must still call g_variant_dict_unref()
     * afterwards.
     *
     * You will typically want to use a heap-allocated #GVariantDict when
     * you expose it as part of an API.  For most other uses, the
     * stack-allocated form will be more convenient.
     *
     * Consider the following two examples that do the same thing in each
     * style: take an existing dictionary and look up the "count" uint32
     * key, adding 1 to it if it is found, or returning an error if the
     * key is not found.  Each returns the new dictionary as a floating
     * #GVariant.
     *
     * ## Using a stack-allocated GVariantDict
     *
     *
     * ```c
     *   GVariant *
     *   add_to_count (GVariant  *orig,
     *                 GError   **error)

     *       {

     *         g_variant_dict_clear (&dict);
     *         return NULL;
     *       }

    /**
     * This section introduces the GVariant type system. It is based, in
     * large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
     * some minor lifting of restrictions. The
     * [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
     * therefore, provides a significant amount of
     * information that is useful when working with GVariant.
     *
     * The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
     * introduction of maybe (or "nullable") types.  Any type in GVariant can be
     * converted to a maybe type, in which case, "nothing" (or "null") becomes a
     * valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
     * character "m" to type strings.
     *
     * The second major change is that the GVariant type system supports the
     * concept of "indefinite types" -- types that are less specific than
     * the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
     * of "an array of any type" in GVariant, where the D-Bus type system
     * would require you to speak of "an array of integers" or "an array of
     * strings".  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
     * characters "*", "?" and "r" to type strings.
     *
     * Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
     * types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
     * may only appear nested inside of arrays.
     *
     * Just as in D-Bus, GVariant types are described with strings ("type
     * strings").  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
     * are of the same form as those found in D-Bus.  Note, however: D-Bus
     * always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
     * strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, "signatures"
     * are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
     * message.  GVariant deals with single values directly so GVariant type
     * strings always describe the type of exactly one value.  This means
     * that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid GVariant type
     * string -- except in the case that it is the signature of a message
     * containing exactly one argument.
     *
     * An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
     * abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
     * indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
     * that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
     * g_variant_get_type() will never return an indefinite type, but
     * calling g_variant_is_of_type() with an indefinite type may return
     * %TRUE.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents "an
     * array of no particular type", but you can have an "array of integers"
     * which certainly matches the type of "an array of no particular type",
     * since "array of integers" is a subtype of "array of no particular
     * type".
     *
     * This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
     * directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
     * non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
     * the type of #GtkBin can exist (since #GtkBin is an abstract class),
     * but a #GtkWindow can certainly be instantiated, and you would say
     * that the #GtkWindow is a #GtkBin (since #GtkWindow is a subclass of
     * #GtkBin).
     *
     * ## GVariant Type Strings
     *
     * A GVariant type string can be any of the following:
     *
     * - any basic type string (listed below)
     *
     * - "v", "r" or "*"
     *
     * - one of the characters 'a' or 'm', followed by another type string
     *
     * - the character '(', followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
     *   type strings, followed by the character ')'
     *
     * - the character '{', followed by a basic type string (see below),
     *   followed by another type string, followed by the character '}'
     *
     * A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
     * g_variant_type_is_basic()) and is always a single character in length.
     * The valid basic type strings are "b", "y", "n", "q", "i", "u", "x", "t",
     * "h", "d", "s", "o", "g" and "?".
     *
     * The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. "aaaaai" and
     * "(ui(nq((y)))s)" are both valid type strings, as is
     * "a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))". In order to not hit memory limits, #GVariant
     * imposes a limit on recursion depth of 65 nested containers. This is the
     * limit in the D-Bus specification (64) plus one to allow a #GDBusMessage to
     * be nested in a top-level tuple.
     *
     * The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:
     * - `b`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN; a boolean value.
     * - `y`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE; a byte.
     * - `n`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16; a signed 16 bit integer.
     * - `q`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
     * - `i`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32; a signed 32 bit integer.
     * - `u`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
     * - `x`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64; a signed 64 bit integer.
     * - `t`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
     * - `h`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE; a signed 32 bit value
     *   that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
     *   descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
     * - `d`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE; a double precision
     *   floating point value.
     * - `s`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING; a string.
     * - `o`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH; a string in the form
     *   of a D-Bus object path.
     * - `g`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE; a string in the form of
     *   a D-Bus type signature.
     * - `?`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC; an indefinite type that
     *   is a supertype of any of the basic types.
     * - `v`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT; a container type that
     *   contain any other type of value.
     * - `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
     *   type; the type string "ai", for example, is the type of an array of
     *   signed 32-bit integers.
     * - `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a "maybe", or
     *   "nullable", version of that type; the type string "ms", for example,
     *   is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
     *   nothing.
     * - `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
     *   create a tuple type; the type string "(is)", for example, is the type of
     *   a pair of an integer and a string.
     * - `r`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE; an indefinite type that is
     *   a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
     * - `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
     *   string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
     *   an array to form a dictionary; the type string "a{sd}", for example, is
     *   the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
     *   point values.
     *
     *   The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
     *   the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
     *   basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
     * - `*`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY; the indefinite type that is
     *   a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
     *   character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
     *   to mean "any number of items".
     *
     * Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
     * itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string "a*"
     * (corresponding to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY) is an indefinite type
     * that is a supertype of every array type. "(*s)" is a supertype
     * of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
     * item is a string.
     *
     * "a{?*}" is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
     * containing dictionary entries where the key is any basic type and
     * the value is any type at all.  This is, by definition, a dictionary,
     * so this type string corresponds to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DICTIONARY. Note
     * that, due to the restriction that the key of a dictionary entry must
     * be a basic type, "{**}" is not a valid type string.

    /**
     * The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex
     * (mutual exclusion). It can be used to protect data against shared
     * access.
     *
     * Take for example the following function:
     *
     * ```c
     *   int
     *   give_me_next_number (void)
     *   {
     *     static int current_number = 0;
     *
     *     // now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new
     *     // number, this might for example be a random number generator
     *     current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
     *
     *     return current_number;
     *   }
     * ```
     *
     * It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
     * application. There current_number must be protected against shared
     * access. A #GMutex can be used as a solution to this problem:
     *
     * ```c
     *   int
     *   give_me_next_number (void)
     *   {
     *     static GMutex mutex;
     *     static int current_number = 0;
     *     int ret_val;
     *
     *     g_mutex_lock (&mutex);
     *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
     *     g_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
     *
     *     return ret_val;
     *   }
     * ```
     *
     * Notice that the #GMutex is not initialised to any particular value.
     * Its placement in static storage ensures that it will be initialised
     * to all-zeros, which is appropriate.
     *
     * If a #GMutex is placed in other contexts (eg: embedded in a struct)
     * then it must be explicitly initialised using g_mutex_init().
     *
     * A #GMutex should only be accessed via g_mutex_ functions.
