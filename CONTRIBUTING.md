# Creating PRs
If you're making PRs, you likely know what to include already.

Here are some general guidelines:
+ Follow the code style:
  + Use indents of four spaces in code and two spaces in documentation.
  + Use camel case and do not abbreviate variable names.
+ If you are changing the gschema, please recompile:
```bash
glib-compile-schemas ./schemas/
```
+ Do not change colors in the Sass. Use the variables at the top to color elements.

You also may benefit from some instructions on compiling the Sass stylesheet:

## Modifying the Stylesheet
The stylesheet is written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) so it must be compiled before reloading it.
First, make sure to install the Sass command line tool with `npm`:
```bash
npm install -g sass
```
Once Sass is installed, then:
1) Make changes to the `stylesheet.scss` file as you please.
2) Compile the file, and generate a sourcemap:
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/material-shell@papyelgringo
sass stylesheet.scss:stylesheet.css --sourcemap
```
3) Reload GNOME Shell:
  + On X.org: hit `Alt+F2` and type the command `r`
  + On Wayland: Log out and back in
